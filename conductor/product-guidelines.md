# Product Guidelines - SystemVoiceMemos

## Voice and Tone
- **Friendly & Approachable:** The application should use warm, helpful language that makes the technology feel accessible, even to non-technical users. Avoid overly dense jargon where simple explanations suffice.

## Visual Identity
- **Native macOS Experience:** Adhere strictly to Apple's Human Interface Guidelines (HIG). The app should feel like a native part of macOS, using standard system colors, typography (SF Pro), and control patterns.

## Interaction Principles
- **Explicit Recording Status:** High-visibility indicators (like a prominent red dot or dedicated status area) are mandatory to ensure the user is always aware of active capture.
- **Multi-Sensory Feedback:** Supplement visual indicators with subtle audio or haptic cues when recording starts and stops to provide confident confirmation of the app's state.

## Error Handling
- **Action-Oriented Messaging:** Errors should never be dead ends. Every message must clearly explain what happened and provide a direct path or instruction for the user to resolve the issue.

## Growth and Complexity
- **Modular Simplicity:** While we prioritize a clean, one-click recording experience, advanced features should be implemented modularly. Users should be able to toggle "Power User" settings to maintain a minimalist default UI while allowing for deeper functionality when needed.
